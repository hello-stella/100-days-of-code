# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I built the Helen Keller Tribute page for freecodecamp's first project. It needs to be edited tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I am so happy to start my #100daysofcode challenge today. I passed 7/10 requirements, I will try to make it 10/10 tomorrow. I need to learn CSS in order to style the page.

### Day 2: February 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finally submitted Tribute Page on Freecodecamp. Passed 10/10 requirements now. Feeling happy!

**Thoughts:** It's been a while! I haven't coded for a while and the time really flies. I will not give up this time on learning.
